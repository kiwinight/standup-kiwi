# Standup Kiwi - Pricing Strategy

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**"Simple pricing for a simple tool"**

- Open source foundation with self-hosting option
- Managed service for convenience
- Pay-per-user, per-board model
- No complex tiers or feature restrictions

---

## üí∞ Pricing Model

### **Self-Hosting**

```
Price: FREE forever
Includes: All features, unlimited users, unlimited boards
Requirements: Basic server knowledge for deployment
```

### **Managed Service**

```
Price: $1/user/month per board
Free Trial: 30 days full access
Billing: Per active user on each board
```

---

## üìä How Billing Works

### **Board-Based Pricing**

Each board is billed independently based on the number of active participants.

**Examples:**

- **Personal Board**: Alex only ‚Üí `$1/month`
- **Team Board**: Alex + Bob + Carol ‚Üí `$3/month`
- **Multiple Boards**: Each board billed separately

### **User Counting**

- **Active participants**: Users who have access to the board
- **Board owner**: Always counted as 1 user
- **Collaborators**: Each invited user = +$1/month for that board

---

## üÜì Free Trial Details

### **30-Day Trial**

- **Duration**: Full 30 days of access
- **Scope**: Account-wide (all boards during trial period)
- **Features**: Complete access to all managed service features
- **No Credit Card**: Required only when converting to paid

### **Why 30 Days?**

- Standups are about building habits
- 2 weeks is too short to form routines
- 4 weeks allows full evaluation of daily use
- Generous trial shows confidence in product value

---

## ü§ñ AI Features Strategy

### **User-Provided API Keys**

- Users input their own OpenAI API key
- Direct billing between user and OpenAI
- No markup or AI usage charges from Standup Kiwi
- Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### **Benefits:**

- **Transparent costs**: Users pay exactly what they use
- **Data privacy**: API keys remain user-controlled
- **No variable costs**: Predictable pricing for us
- **User choice**: Select preferred AI models

## üé≠ Competitive Positioning

### **vs Self-Hosting Complexity**

```
Competitor Self-Host: Complex setup, maintenance required
Standup Kiwi Self-Host: Simple deployment, community support
Standup Kiwi Managed: Zero setup, $1/user/month
```

### **vs Traditional Standup Tools**

```
Slack: Free but scattered, hard to track
Trello: $5/user/month, complex for standups
Linear: $8/user/month, project management overkill
Standup Kiwi: $1/user/month, purpose-built for standups
```

---

## üìà Revenue Model

### **Target Segments**

1. **Individual developers**: Personal boards ($1/month)
2. **Small teams**: 3-10 person teams ($3-10/month)
3. **Startups**: Multiple project boards ($5-50/month)
4. **Cost-conscious teams**: Alternative to expensive PM tools

### **Unit Economics**

```
Average Board Size: 3-5 users
Average Revenue per Board: $3-5/month
Server costs per board: ~$0.10/month
Target gross margin: >90%
```

## üöÄ Go-to-Market Strategy

### **Phase 1: Beta Launch**

- 30-day free trial for all users
- Community feedback and iteration
- Price testing with early adopters

### **Phase 2: Pricing Validation**

- Monitor trial-to-paid conversion rates
- Gather user feedback on pricing
- Adjust if necessary ($0.50-$2 range)

### **Phase 3: Scale**

- Establish pricing confidence
- Focus on user acquisition
- Potential enterprise features

## ‚ùì FAQ for Internal Reference

### **"Why not freemium with limited features?"**

- We offer complete self-hosting option
- Managed service premium is for convenience, not features
- Simpler to maintain single feature set

### **"Why $1/user instead of flat team pricing?"**

- Scales with value (more users = more value)
- Predictable costs for users
- Industry standard approach

### **"What if users abuse trial period?"**

- 30 days is account-wide, not per-board
- Email verification required
- Normal business risk for freemium models

### **"How do we handle team member changes?"**

- Billing adjusts automatically
- Add member = +$1/month
- Remove member = -$1/month
- Pro-rated billing

---

## üîÑ Future Considerations

### **Potential Adjustments**

- Pricing may adjust based on market response
- Could introduce team discounts (5+ users)
- Enterprise features for larger organizations

### **AI Feature Evolution**

- May introduce managed AI option later
- Would be additive to base pricing
- API key approach remains primary

### **Self-Hosting Support**

- Community support remains free
- Potential paid support tier for enterprises
- Professional services for deployment assistance
