# Standup Kiwi

**Standup Kiwi** is an open-source tool for sharing and recording daily standups — async or live — in a calm, clear, and effortless way.

## Why Standup Kiwi?

Tools like JIRA, Linear, or Notion can be adapted for standups — but they’re built for project tracking, not simple async check-ins.

Standup Kiwi provides a focused space for daily standups, scrums, or async check-ins.  
Each standup is saved as a card and organized by boards, with features that make writing and reviewing standups fast and easy.

## How It Works

1. _Create a board_  
   Set up a board for your team, project, or personal tracking. Boards help organize standups by context — like engineering, marketing, or solo work.

2. _Write your standup_  
   Share what you did yesterday, what you're planning today, and anything blocking progress. Use the markdown editor to format your update clearly.

3. _Browse standups_  
   Catch up on today’s or past standups without digging through chats or threads. Each one becomes a card on the board.

4. _Repeat, your way_  
   Use Standup Kiwi async or alongside live meetings. Your standup history is always there to review, reflect, or revisit.

## Use Cases

- Async daily standups for remote or hybrid teams who want to skip live meetings
- Live meeting prep — write standups in advance and use the shared board to stay focused and on track
- Personal productivity journaling to reflect on your daily progress

## Beta Notice

Standup Kiwi is currently in beta. Many features are still in development, and things may change quickly. We’re actively improving the app — feedback and contributions are always welcome!
