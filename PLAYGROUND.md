So.. as it's offline on the plane, what can I try during the flight?

- Guest mode
  - What is a guest mode by the way?
    - Data is stored locally..? - yes
    - Does it require an internet? - no
    - No collaboration? - yes
    - This is not worth it. It might be better to give a demo account. So they can tryout stuffs?
    - Or a try demo -> provide an interactive onboarding experience.

Try demo

- /access?demo=true
- /access/sign-in-with-acccess-cde?demo=true

Okay this would be a very good onboarding if it exists.

Collaboartion..

Okay so the collaboration is or course the most important feature. How am I going to display the cards? Let me prototype this.
