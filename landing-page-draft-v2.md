## 🔥 Problem Section

### The Problem We All Face

**Are you tired of...?**

- **Daily standup meetings** that drag on for 30 minutes when everyone just needs to share quick updates?
- **Scattered updates** buried in Slack threads that you can never find later?
- **Over-engineered tools** like Jira, Notion templates, or Linear that feel like overkill for simple daily check-ins?
- **No record** so when your boss asks "what's your team been working on?" you scramble to remember?

_You're not alone. Thousands of developers, designers, and remote workers waste hours every week on broken standup processes._

### Visual Problem Demonstration

## ✨ Meet Standup Kiwi

**The lightweight standup tool that actually works.**

Standup Kiwi is designed for one thing: making daily standups effortless and meaningful. No complex features you don't need. No meetings that drag on. Just clean, organized updates that help you and your team stay in sync.

**The difference:**

### 1. Replace 30-minute meetings with 5-minute updates

Skip the scheduling conflicts and time zone nightmares. Write your update when it's convenient, read everyone else's when you need to. No more sitting through meetings where you're only interested in 5 minutes of content.

### 2. Everything organized in one place

No more digging through endless Slack threads or trying to remember "what channel was that update in?" All your team's progress lives in clean, organized cards with a clear browsable history.

### 3. Simple and focused - built just for standups

Unlike Jira, Notion templates, or Linear, Standup Kiwi does one thing really well: daily standups. No complex project management features you don't need, no overwhelming setup process, just clean daily updates.

### 4. Never lose track of what your team accomplished

When your boss asks "what's your team been working on this week?" you'll have a clear, browsable history instead of scrambling to remember. Perfect for performance reviews, progress reports, and onboarding new team members.

### 5. Your data, your control - open source and self-hostable

Built transparently in the open with no vendor lock-in. Keep everything on your own servers if you want, or use our hosted version. Either way, your standup data belongs to you, not buried in some proprietary system.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Simple as 1-2-3

**1. Create Your Board**

<!-- _[Video demo: 30 seconds showing board creation flow]_ -->

_[Screenshot: Board creation flow]_

- Clicking "Create Board"
- Naming the board
- Inviting team members
- Setting timezone

Set up a personal board or team workspace in seconds. Name it whatever makes sense—"Daily Progress," "Team Alpha," or just your name. No complex setup, no admin approval needed.

**2. Write Your Update**

<!-- _[Video demo: 45 seconds showing update creation]_ -->

_[Screenshot: Standup creation flow]_

- Opening the update form
- Using markdown editor features
- Adding yesterday/today/blockers sections
- Preview and submit

Answer the classic questions: What did you do yesterday? What's planned for today? Any blockers? Use our clean markdown editor to format lists, add links, and make your updates scannable.

**3. Stay Organized**

<!-- _[Video demo: 30 seconds showing board navigation]_ -->

_[Screenshot: Board navigation]_

- Browsing today's updates
- Filtering by date/person
- Searching past updates
- Grid vs. feed view toggle

Your updates become organized cards on a clean board. Browse today's updates, review past work, and never lose track of progress again. Everything is right where you need it, when you need it.
