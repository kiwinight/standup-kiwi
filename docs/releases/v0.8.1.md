# v0.8.1

This release focuses on stability and repository organization. It fixes a crash that could occur when the local date changed and moves the website to its own repository, while migrating release notes into this monorepo.

## Maintenance

- **Repository Reorganization**  
  Split the public website into its own repository. Removed `sites/website/*` from this monorepo for clearer separation and faster iteration.

- **Package Metadata**  
  Minor adjustments in `package.json` to reflect the repo changes.

## Documentation

- **Release Notes Migration**  
  Migrated all historical release notes into `docs/releases` and added v0.8.0 for completeness.

## Bugfixes

- **Fix crash after local date change**  
  Addressed an issue where opening or returning to the app after the calendar day changed could cause a crash in board views. The fix updates date handling across the current user standup card and grid/feed views to ensure reliable rendering when the day rolls over. PRs #104, #105.
