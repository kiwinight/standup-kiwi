# v0.8.0

This release introduces shared boards with collaborators. You can now turn any board into a shared space: invite teammates, assign roles, and manage membership — all in-app.

## Features

- **Shared Boards and Collaborators**  
  Invite collaborators, assign roles (including a new member role), update/remove collaborators, and leave a board.

- **Board Invitations**  
  Create and regenerate invitation links; accept invitations via dedicated routes.

- **Richer Standup Views**  
  New grid and feed views with support for multiple standups per day and a focused “today’s standup” for the current user.

- **New Landing Page**  
  A refreshed website with an interactive demo and animations.

## Improvements

- **Personal Board Layout Alignment**  
  The personal board experience is now aligned with the team board layout.

- **Clearer Empty States**  
  Improved empty-history UI for past standups.

- **Authentication Structure**  
  Introduced a permissive auth guard/service and refined session/token handling.

- **Shared Types Across API & Web**  
  Consolidated TypeScript types to improve consistency and developer experience.

- **Auth Path Rename**  
  Cleaned up routing and renamed email auth paths to `/auth/email/...`.

- **Database Updates**  
  Schema and migrations to support collaborator roles and invitation workflow.

## Bugfixes

- **Safari Reliability**  
  Fixed Safari-specific runtime and login issues.

- **Route Loader Stability**  
  Resolved a crash caused by a non-null assertion during route loader data destructuring.
