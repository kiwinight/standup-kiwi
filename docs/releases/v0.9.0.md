# v0.9.0

This release introduces customizable standup forms with a visual form builder, letting you tailor your board's questions to match your team's specific workflow. We've also added admin role protection to board settings and fixed line breaks in standup responses.

## Features

- **Customizable Standup Forms**  
  Build your own standup form with a visual form builder in board settings. Add, edit, remove, duplicate, and reorder fields to match your team's needs. Each field supports custom labels, placeholders, help text descriptions, and can be marked as required or optional. Reorder fields with drag-and-drop on desktop or arrow buttons on mobile. Changes apply immediately for all board members.

## Improvements

- **Admin Role Protection for Settings**  
  Board settings including name, timezone, standup forms, and invitation management now require admin privileges to modify. This prevents accidental changes while keeping settings visible to all collaborators. Non-admin users see a clear info message and disabled controls.

- **Form Builder Dependencies**  
  Added motion/react (framer-motion) for smooth drag-and-drop interactions in the form builder.

## Bugfixes

- **Line Break Rendering**  
  Fixed markdown rendering to treat single line breaks as hard breaks. This improves the experience for users unfamiliar with markdown's double-space-newline syntax, making text formatting more intuitive and natural.
