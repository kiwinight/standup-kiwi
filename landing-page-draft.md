## 🔥 Problem Section

### The Problem We All Face

**Are you tired of...?**

- **Daily standup meetings** that drag on for 30 minutes when everyone just needs to share quick updates?
- **Scattered updates** buried in Slack threads that you can never find later?
- **Over-engineered tools** like Jira, Notion templates, or Linear that feel like overkill for simple daily check-ins?
- **No record** so when your boss asks "what's your team been working on?" you scramble to remember?

_You're not alone. Thousands of developers, designers, and remote workers waste hours every week on broken standup processes._

## ✨ Meet Standup Kiwi

**The lightweight standup tool that actually works.**

Standup Kiwi is designed for one thing: making daily standups effortless and meaningful. No complex features you don't need. No meetings that drag on. Just clean, organized updates that help you and your team stay in sync.

**The difference:**

- 👀 **Scan everyone's updates in 2 minutes** instead of sitting through 30-minute meetings
- 📋 **Everything in one place** - no more digging through Slack threads
- 🎯 **Simple and focused** - built just for standups, not project management
- 📋 **Team progress at your fingertips** - never scramble when asked "what's your team working on?"
- 📊 **Clean visual layout** - see the whole team's progress at a glance
- 🔓 **Your data, your control** - open source and self-hostable

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Simple as 1-2-3

**1. Create Your Board**
Set up a personal board or team workspace in seconds. Name it whatever makes sense—"Daily Progress," "Team Alpha," or just your name. No complex setup, no admin approval needed.

**2. Write Your Update**  
Answer the classic questions: What did you do yesterday? What's planned for today? Any blockers? Use our clean markdown editor to format lists, add links, and make your updates scannable.

**3. Stay Organized**
Your updates become organized cards on a clean board. Browse today's updates, review past work, and never lose track of progress again. Everything is right where you need it, when you need it.

### Real Example

_"Every morning, I grab my coffee and spend 5 minutes updating my personal board. It's become my favorite way to start the day—I feel more organized and way less stressed about forgetting important tasks."_ —Alex, Product Engineer

_Try it once, and you'll never go back to chaotic standup meetings._
