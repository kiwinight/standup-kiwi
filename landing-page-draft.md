## 🔥 Problem Section

### The Problem We All Face

**Are you tired of...?**

- **15-minute standup meetings** that could have been a 2-minute update?
- **Scattered updates** buried in Slack threads that you can never find later?
- **Heavy project management tools** like Jira that feel like overkill for simple daily check-ins?
- **Starting your day** wondering "what was I working on again?"

_You're not alone. Thousands of developers, designers, and remote workers waste hours every week on broken standup processes._

## ✨ Solution Section

### Meet Standup Kiwi

**The lightweight standup tool that actually works.**

Standup Kiwi is designed for one thing: making daily standups effortless and meaningful. No complex features you don't need. No meetings that drag on. Just clean, organized updates that help you and your team stay in sync.

**Built for modern work:**

- ⚡ **5-minute daily routine** instead of long meetings
- 📝 **Markdown support** for clear, formatted updates
- 🏠 **Work from anywhere** - fully async-friendly
- 📋 **Organized history** - find past updates instantly
- 🔓 **Your data, your control** - open source and self-hostable

## 🚀 How It Works

### Simple as 1-2-3

**1. Create Your Board**
Set up a personal board or team workspace in seconds. Name it whatever makes sense—"Daily Progress," "Team Alpha," or just your name. No complex setup, no admin approval needed.

**2. Write Your Update**  
Answer the classic questions: What did you do yesterday? What's planned for today? Any blockers? Use our clean markdown editor to format lists, add links, and make your updates scannable.

**3. Stay Organized**
Your updates become organized cards on a clean board. Browse today's updates, search past work, and never lose track of progress again. Everything is right where you need it, when you need it.

### Real Example

_"Every morning, I grab my coffee and spend 5 minutes updating my personal board. It's become my favorite way to start the day—I feel more organized and way less stressed about forgetting important tasks."_ —Alex, Product Engineer

_Try it once, and you'll never go back to chaotic standup meetings._
