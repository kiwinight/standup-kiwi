- So.. is there going to be another pepsico project? I heard it's ending soon. In july
- Suppose it's keep going, should I be involved? or not..

--

Anthropic projects are..

cons

- feel redundant
- doesn't feel like I'm a developer

pros

- less time input (compared to development work)

---

Pepsico projects are..

cons

- time consuming, in general
- Code is a fucking mess + no systematic 장치 to resolve this
- More meetings, less async communication -> time consuming

pros

- It's a development job
- More meeting -> I can practice english

---

Thoughts..

- If I'm going to keep working on building saas as my business, it might be worth to work on my saas app instead of pepsico
- I don't think I don't want to work on dev job on turing. The code makes me sick. It's a bad influence on me.
- More AI focused job might be worth it to me.

Possible option

- Go back to Anthropic project and work for several months, and hop back in?
